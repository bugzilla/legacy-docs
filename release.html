<h2><a name="release_planning"></a>Release Planning</h2>

<p>This is where we <em>plan</em> to have a release, long before
    the actual release is done.</p>

<h3><a name="file_bugs"></a>File Bugs</h3>

<p>File bugs for the following things...</p>

<ol>
    <li>&quot;Release Bugzilla X.YY, Z.AA&quot; and mark it
        as severity &quot;blocker.&quot; It should block 
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=bz-release">bug
        286269</a>, which has the alias <strong>bz-release</strong>. (Sample: 
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=559988">bug 
        559988</a>)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Security Advisory</strong>: It should block the first bug,
        and and Security bugs targeted at this release should be dependencies.
        (Sample: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=290249">bug
        290249</a>)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Release Notes</strong>: Point releases and rc1 versions
        need release notes. Each version being released needs a separate
        Release Notes bug filed. These bugs should block the first bug. For 
        final releases of major versions, you need a &quot;clean up release
        notes&quot; bug. (Sample: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286274">bug
        286274</a>)</li>
        
    <li><strong>New Features Page</strong> (Release Candidates and Final 
        Releases Only): Make this bug depend on the appropriate Release 
        Notes bug. (Sample: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286278">bug 
        286278</a>)</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="motivate_people"></a>Motivate People</h3>

<p>Basically, just make it <em>really</em> easy to find and access
    all the bugs that need to be fixed for the release. I usually do
    this a few days after I file the above bugs.</p>
    
<p>This means:</p>


<ol>
    <li>Do a search for blockers for the release, and make the query link into
        a <a href="http://tinyurl.com">tinyurl</a>.
        When creating a tinyurl, make sure that no "order by" information is
        part of the URL so that you don't break people's LASTORDER cookies.</li>
    <li>Put that tinyurl at the very end of the topic line of the 
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Communicate">#mozwebtools
        IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org</a>, with a brief explanation like 
        &quot;2.20 Blockers: <var>tinyurl</var>&quot;.</li>
    <li>Send out an email to developers&#64;bugzilla.org explaining
        that we're releasing, and include the tinyurl. Having just <em>one</em>
        link in the email gets people to focus a bit more.</li>
    <li>If you are desperate: Send out an email to 
        <a href="http://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/support-bugzilla">support-bugzilla</a>
        with a tinyurl pointing to <em>all</em> bugs targeted at your release,
        sorted by Importance. Explain that you'd like some help, and
        link them also to the 
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Developers">Contributor's
        Guide</a></li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="pre_release"></a>Pre-Release</h2>

<p>Basically, you just have to get all the bugs to have patches with
    review+ on them. A few of them require some special handling:</p>
    
<h3><a name="security_advisory"></a>Security Advisory</h3>

<h4>Format</h4>

<p>The actual &quot;issues&quot; in a security advisory normally look 
    something like this:</p>

<pre>Class:       Cross-site scripting
Versions:    2.15 through 2.18rc3 and 2.19.1 (from cvs)
Description: It is possible to blah blah blah...
             And here are some details on how it can be made less bad...
Reference:   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272620
CVE Name:    CAN-2004-1061</pre>

<p>The different values for <strong>Class</strong> can be found in
    older <a href="../security/">Security Advisories</a>.
    The &quot;CVE Name&quot; is, obviously, not always needed.</p>

<h4>Determining Affected Versions</h4>

<p>It also can be a bit tricky to determine the earliest version affected
    by a security bug. What I do is use 
    <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/">Loggerhead's</a> "Files"
    interface to find the place where the patched code was first introduced.
    (That is, the code the Security bug is modifying.) Then, by looking at
    the Changes log in Loggerhead, you can match that up with the dates on the
    <a href="../releases/">Release Information</a> page.</p>
    
<h4>Getting it Reviewed</h4>

<p>Security Advisories get sent to security&#64;bugzilla.org for review.
    Allow at least two or three days for the members of the list to
    respond.</p>

<p>If you don't get a response after three or four days, that probably
    means the advisory is fine. But still check with people on IRC and
    get them to look at it.</p>

<h3><a name="release_notes"></a>Release Notes</h3>

<p>The actual process of writing Release Notes is described in the
    <a href="../docs/releasenote.html">Release Noting Guide</a>. The
    important thing to remember about Release Notes is that they should
    be sent to reviewers&#64;bugzilla.org for comment. Give the list
    about two days to respond.</p>

<p>They should also be attached normally to the bug, and you should ask
    some Documentation reviewer to look over them.</p>


<h2><a name="right_before_release"></a>Right Before Release</h2>

<p>Releasing Bugzilla can take a <em>long time</em>. I think the fastest I ever
    did it was six hours. Start the process a day before you actually
    want to release.</p> 

<h3><a name="web_site_updates"></a>Web Site Updates</h3>

<h4>Check Out From CVS</h4>

<p>In order to update the website, the first thing you have to do is
  check out its code from CVS. The best place to do this is on
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/">landfill</a>, because it
  already has the environment set up to be able to fully build the website.
  Make sure you have checkin access on cvs.mozilla.org.</p>

<p>The CVS info is:</p>

<p><kbd>CVSROOT=:ext:user%domain.com@cvs.mozilla.org:/www<br />
  cvs -z3 checkout bugzilla-org</kbd></p>

<p>Or, if you don't have checkin access, but you want to work on the web
  site updates anyhow, the CVSROOT for anonymous access is:</p>

<p><kbd>CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/www</kbd></p>

<h4>Automatic Website Updater</h4>

<p>There is now a script that does most of the web site updates for a release,
  called <kbd>bin/do-release.pl</kbd> in the website checkout. You use it like
  this:</p>

<p><kbd>bin/do-release.pl --security=3.2.6 3.7.1 3.6.1 3.4.7 3.2.7</kbd></p>

<p>That updates your local checkout as though you were going to do a release
  of 3.7.1, 3.6.1, 3.4.7, and 3.2.7, with a security advisory where the lowest
  <em>unfixed</em> version being fixed was 3.2.6.</p>

<p>This script will update the files in your checkout appropriately for the
  release, and will also print a lot of messages like "<kbd>** Remember to update 
  some/file.html</kbd>". Those "remember" messages are files that are <em>not</em>
  updated by the script, and will have to be updated by you. The updates that
  need to be done to those files are described below in the "Manual Website
  Updating" section below.</p>

<p>Now, search the src/ directory for "FIXME": <kbd>grep -R src/ FIXME</kbd></p>

<p>The results show places where you probably need to update the files. Some
  of the FIXMEs are dates, and you don't know the date of the release yet, so
  you can leave those as FIXME. But the other FIXMEs need to be fixed now.</p>

<h4>Manual Website Updating</h4>

<p>Before we had the automatic updater script, we used to do all the website
  updates by hand. This section preserves the full instructions for how to
  update the website for a release, in case you need to understand exactly
  what the automatic script is doing, or in case you need to understand how
  to update one of the files that the script doesn't update.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a directory for the Security Advisory. The directory is always
        numbered by <em>the lowest <strong>unfixed</strong> version that is
        being <strong>fixed</strong></em>. For example, if you release
        versions 2.16.9, 2.18.1, and 2.19.3, and they all have a single
        Security Advisory, the security advisory goes into the 2.16.8/ 
        directory.</li>
    
    <li>For each new release, create a &quot;Release Info&quot; page:
        <ul>
            <li>Create a directory in the releases/ directory for 
                the new release.</li>
            <li>Copy over the index.html.tmpl file from the previous 
                release on that branch.</li>
            <li>Edit any links to point to the right place for the new
                version.</li>
            <li>Change any text that refers to the previous version to instead
                refer to this version. This includes at least the title and
                the text at the top.</li>
            <li>Open Firefox and go to the branch
                installation on landfill. Open up the release notes and
                save them as &quot;Web Page, complete&quot;--this will
                make all relative links into absolute links so that you
                can copy the page to the website. Just remove the
                Bugzilla page header and page footer, and you can
                pase the code basically directly as the Release Notes
                page.

                <p>Do make sure that the <kbd>docs_urlbase</kbd> parameter
                  on the branch installation points to the correct docs
                  on bugzilla.org first, though.</p></li>
            <li>Link to the appropriate new Security Advisory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Update lib/releases-list.txt, which controls the main Release
      Information page.</li>
    
    <li>Patch the /status/changes.html.tmpl to reflect the new releases.
        If the patch has a &quot;FIXME&quot; date in it, remember 
        to fix it!</li>

    <li>Post the News announcement in /news/.</li>
    
    <li>Update the main index.html.tmpl to point to the new News item,
        and remove the last News item from being listed on the main page.</li>
    
    <li>Now actually put the Security Advisory into the directory. You
        could have done this earlier, but it usually takes a while to
        get the Security Advisory complete and reviewed, so I put it last,
        here.</li>

    <li>Update security/index.html.tmpl to include a link to the new 
        Security Advisory.</li>

    <li>Update docs/index.html.tmpl to display the latest version numbers
        for the links to the docs.</li>
</ol>

<p>And now you should be done with the web site update! Don't check in
your changes to CVS yet -- that comes later.</p>

<h3><a name="commit_security_bugs"></a>Check-In Security Bugs</h3>

<p>Locate approved patches on Security bugs, and check them in now 
    to CVS. If the person who wrote the patches is around, 
    have them do it.</p>

<p>Once you hit this point, you are committed to releasing, because
    you've essentially exposed Security bugs publically without
    a release that fixes them.</p>

<h3><a name="freeze_the_tree"></a>Freeze the Tree</h3>

<p>This is only here so that you remember to do it. Basically, just make
    sure that from this point until after you post the tarballs, there
    aren't any checkins to any branch, from anybody but you.</p>

<h3><a name="update_versions"></a>Update Version Numbers</h3>

<p>For each branch that you are releasing:

<ol>
    <li>Update Bugzilla/Constants.pm's BUGZILLA_VERSION variable.</li>
    <li>Update docs/en/xml/Bugzilla-Guide.xml. bz-ver, bz-date,
      bz-nextver, and current-year need to be updated. You may
      also have to update landfillbase if you just branched.</li>
    <li>For 4.3 and newer, instead of docs/en/xml/Bugzilla-Guide.xml
      you need to update docss/bugzilla.ent.tmpl.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="tag_releases"></a>Tag the Releases in CVS and Bzr</h3>

<p>Tagging releases in bzr is easy--after you update the version
  number, just do <kbd>bzr tag bugzilla-version.number.here</kbd>
  in a checkout that can write to the bzr.mozilla.org repository.</p>

<p>For CVS, there is a script that can automatically tag releases for
  you, in the website checkout, called <kbd>bin/tag-releases.pl</kbd>.
  To use it, do: <kbd>bin/tag-releases.pl 3.7.1 3.6.1 3.4.7 3.2.7</kbd>
  or whatever the appropriate version numbers are for your release.
  It also has a <kbd>--dry-run</kbd> switch that you can use to
  test your changes before you actually do the tagging.</p>

<h3><a name="create_the_tarballs"></a>Create the Tarballs</h3>

<p>First, wait about 5 minutes after you do the CVS tags.
    This is because tarballs are pulled from cvs-mirror.mozilla.org, 
    and you need to wait for that server to be updated with the tags.</p>
    
<p>There's a script for building Bugzilla tarballs,
   in the <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/misc/build">misc/build
   bzr repository</a>.</p> 

<p>Just build a tarball for each release, using the version-specific
    CVS or bzr tags that you made above. (Don't use the -BRANCH or _Stable
    tags.)</p>

<h3>Make the Diff Files</h3>

<p>In addition to tarballs, you also need to generate the .diff files.
    For this, you'll need an unpacked tarball of every Bugzilla release
    from each series you're releasing against.</p>

<p>There's a script called makediffs.pl in the 
   <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/misc/build">misc/build
   bzr repository</a> that will generate diff files for every
   .tar.gz file in your current directory.</p>

<p>Development versions don't need .diff files, and neither do
    Release Candidates.</p>

<h3><a name="update_checksetup_tinderbox"></a>Update the Checksetup
    Tinderbox</h3>

<p>There is a tinderbox that lives on cg-bugs01.mozilla.org for testing
    checksetup.pl's upgrade ability. It does this by having a copy
    of a populated database from every version.</p>

<p>When you make a new release, you need to copy the &quot;_branch&quot;
    or &quot;_tip&quot; database to a database named after the release.</p>

<p>For example, for the 3.6.1 and 3.7.1 release, you might do this:</p>

<pre>mysqlclone "-h landfill.bugzilla.org bugs_tip" bugs_3_7_1
mysqlclone "-h landfill.bugzilla.org bugs_bugzilla3_6_branch" bugs_3_6_1
pgclone bugs_tip bugs_3_7_1
pgclone bugs_bugzilla3_6_branch bugs_3_6_1</pre>

<p>I didn't make a 3.4.7 database, because 3.4.7 had no updates to
    checksetup.pl (so it wasn't any different from the base 3.4, which I
    already had a database for).</p>

<p>Then the <kbd>/home/tinderbox/config-test-checksetup</kbd> files
    also need to be updated. Find the db_list variable and add
    the new databases to it. (The format of the variable is obvious
    once you see it.)</p>

<h2><a name="release"></a>Release</h2>
    
<h3><a name="post_the_files"></a>Post the Files</h3>

<p>Using sftp or scp, upload the tarballs and .diff.gz files to
  stage.mozilla.org, to the /pub/mozilla.org/webtools directory.</p>

<p>Remember to fix the <code>bugzilla-LATEST</code> and 
  <code>bugzilla-STABLE</code> symlinks, if necessary.</p>

<p>Also verify that the uploaded files are world readable so that 
  downloads
  will work properly.</p>

<h3><a name="commit_website"></a>Check-In the Website Updates</h3>

<p>Now, you commit the changes you made to the website, above. Double-check
    everything to make sure that all the dates and times are correct
    anywhere that you had to put a date/time.</p>

<h3><a name="send_security_advisory"></a>Send Security Advisory</h3>

<p>Double-check the Security Advisory before you send it. Make
    sure that any links you have in the Advisory actually work.</p>

<p>Usually, we GPG sign the Security Advisory with a key that
   has its public half available from either public keyservers
   or the bugzilla.org website.</p>

<p>The Security Advisory is sent to:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/post/1">BugTraq</a></li>
    <li>announce&#64;bugzilla.org</li>
    <li>support-bugzilla&#64;lists.mozilla.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Send each as a <em>separate email</em>. This is because you will
    get a lot of bounce messages, and you don't want them to be
    spread around to the other lists. (Some things sending bounce
    messages are really stupid and will attempt to do this.)</p>

<h3><a name="send_release_announcement"></a>Send Release Announcement</h3>
    
<p>This is the Release Announcement that you created on the
    <a href="#file_bugs">bug that you filed</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that you put <kbd>[ANN]</kbd> at the beginning of
 the Subject line.</p>
    
<p>Send it to:

<ul>
    <li>announce&#64;bugzilla.org</li>
    <li>support-bugzilla&#64;lists.mozilla.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, send each as a separate email.</p>

<h2>Post-Release</h2>
        
<p>Stuff you do after you've posted the release and sent the 
    announcements:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Unlock the Security Bugs. Just remove them from the bugzilla-security
        group.</li>
    <li>Update <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/bugzilla/">FreshMeat</a></li>
    <li>Update the VERSION number in Bugzilla/Constants.pm on each branch,
      to have a &quot;+&quot; after it.</li>
    <li>Update bugzilla-update.xml on landfill so that the notification
      system will detect new releases.</li>
</ol>
