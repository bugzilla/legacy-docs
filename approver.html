<h1>Approvers' Guide</h1>

<p>The purpose of approval is for the project leader to be able to keep control
  of the entire Bugzilla product, to ensure similar, bad or conflicting features
  aren't introduced.  Approval does not usually involve in depth review of code,
  although nothing prohibits this. If approval isn't granted, the approver might
  decide to ask for a re-review, a new patch, or resolve the bug entirely without
  check in.

<p>Since the repository is publicly visible, security fixes must only be committed
  immediately before a new package is released. See the documentation on how to
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/release.html">release</a>.</p>
