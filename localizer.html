<h1>Localizers' Guide</h1>

<p>This guide outlines how to make a localised copy of Bugzilla. However, you are strongly advised to make yourself known in the newsgroup (<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.apps.bugzilla">news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.apps.bugzilla</a>) before you start.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The key technology for localising Bugzilla is UI templates.
This separates the content from the presentation.</p>

<p>We recommend that you begin by localising <a href="/download/#stable">the
current stable release</a>.</p>

<h3>Doing the Localization</h3>

<p>I am assuming you are creating a localization for a language code "xx". You
need to create a directory template/xx/default under the Bugzilla root, and
recursively copy the contents of template/en/default into it, leaving out
files which need no translation.
Localizations should not use the "custom" directory, which is for site-specific
customisations only, and is guaranteed not to be overwritten by new Bugzillas
or language packs.</p>

<p>Note that you can create a localization for a two-part RFC 1766 language tag
xx-YY - e.g. "en-GB".  If there is no matching "xx" localization in your
template directory, users specifying "xx" will get the first matching "xx-YY"
localization.  If the user specifies "xx-YY" specifically, and there is no
matching "xx-YY" in the template directory, it will not fall back to "xx".  The
user can choose if they want it to fall back by specifying both in their
browser, in most browsers.  </p>

<p>Once you've got a copy of the templates, start translating the English in
them. It should be obvious what to translate and what not to translate.
Template toolkit directives and variables can be found inside [&#37; &#37;] tags -
don't translate these. You can, however, move them around within a sentence for
localization purposes.</p>

<p>We <b>strongly</b> encourage you to use UTF-8 as character set encoding.
New Bugzilla installations use UTF-8 as default.</p>

<p>Also, some times are formatted in the template using time2str - if this is
true, you can rearrange the time format to suit your locale.</p>

<p>This may take a significant amount of time - there are over 200 templates.
You may wish to share this work among multiple contributors.</p>

<h3>Translating Hard-Coded Strings</h3>

<p>There is a good trick for translating hard-coded strings for display, which
is best demonstrated with a code fragment:</p>

<p>If the original code looks like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
[&#37; order FILTER html &#37;]
</pre>

<p>You can replace it with something like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
[&#37; ordersdesc = {
   "Reuse same sort as last time" =&gt; "zuletzt verwendeter Reihenfolge",
   "Bug Number"   =&gt; "Fehlernummer",
   } &#37;]

[&#37; ordersdesc.$order FILTER html &#37;]
</pre>

<p>You use a hash to map from the hard-coded English to the localised version,
for display only.</p>

<h3>Creating a Localization Pack</h3>

<p>To create a localization pack, tar up the contents of template/xx/default
and make it available. Remember to mark it with the version number of the
Bugzilla it corresponds to.</p>

<p>If you would like it listed in the localizations list on the Bugzilla
<a href="../download.html#localizations">download page</a>, then you need
to set up a web page which at a minimum lists which versions of Bugzilla
your templates are made for, who's maintaining them, and contains links
to the actual language pack tarballs (or instructions for how to retrieve
them from CVS if you prefer to maintain them that way).  Our recommendation
is to set up a project for it on <a href="http://sf.net/">Sourceforge</a>.
The <a href="http://bugzilla-de.sourceforge.net/">German localization</a> is a
very good example, though by no means do you have to get that fancy :)</p>

<h3>Using A Localization</h3>

<p>To install a localization pack, untar it into your Bugzilla directory so it
appears in template/xx/default/ . ('xx' would be replaced with the language
code of the pack you're installing, of course)</p>
