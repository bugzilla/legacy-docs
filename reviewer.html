<h1>Reviewers' Guide</h1>
<p>The following is a guide for reviewers of code submitted for Bugzilla.
   The review process is designed to remove problems from a patch before
   it is checked into the Bugzilla tree, to improve the quality of
   Bugzilla.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Reviewer</h2>

<p>Reviewers are blessed by the project leader as reviewers. If you wish to
   become one, email the project leader.</p>

<p>Before becoming a reviewer, you will generally need to have a demonstrated
   experience of providing reasonable Bugzilla patches. You should also
   understand the contents of this guide and the
   <a href="developer.html">Developers' Guide</a>, and be able to
   demonstrate this if necessary.</p>

<p>Although Bugzilla has a project leader with ultimate authority, the
   project mostly operates on consensus. The reviewers drive the project -
   they are the primary developers, the discussers, and the decision makers.
   They are generally also the "core" developers of Bugzilla, each with their
   own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>As such, reviewers are emissaries for the project, and should act
   reasonably to those who are not reviewers, even when those people are not
   acting reasonably themselves. Unfortunately, people can take the opinion
   of one person as that of the entire project, and that is not in anyone's
   best interest. In particular, this means trying to be civil, as well as
   trying to have a thick skin. If someone is to be given the proverbial
   finger, that should be on the consensus of the reviewers.</p>

<h2>Review Process</h2>

<h3>Beginning The Process</h3>

<p>When a patch is ready to be reviewed, a "review" request is raised,
   usually by the patch author.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>At some stage, the first review will be done. The review will either be
   positive (meaning the reviewer is happy with the patch) or negative
   (meaning they aren't). Typically a negative review will be accompanied by
   reason(s).</p>

<p>A negative review is generally the end of the process, and a new patch will
   generally be expected which takes into account the reasons for the negative
   review.  Occasionally, a negative review might be rescinded and turned into
   a positive one, if the negative review reasons were judged to be
   incorrect.</p>

<p>Upon a positive review, the reviewer may elect to ask for a subsequent
   review, by raising a further review request on another person, if they
   feel the patch is complex or significant enough to warrant special
   attention.</p>

<p>In particular, a security issue must have at least two reviews.
   It is expected, however, that most patches won't need a second review.</p>

<p>Reviews should only be done by blessed reviewers. Reviewers may not review
   a patch they wrote or cowrote. An exception to this is if the patch is a
   backport to a stable branch, in which case the original author should be a
   reviewer if they wasn't the backporter.</p>

<p>If the reviewer feels unqualified to review a part of a patch, they can 
   delegate part of the review to another party who need not be a blessed 
   reviewer.</p>

<p>If the reviewer feels unqualified to review any of the patch, and feels 
   there is a better blessed reviewer, they should attempt to notify a better 
   reviewer.</p>

<p>If the reviewer feels unqualified to review any of the patch, but feels 
   there is no better blessed reviewer, they should review as well as possible,
   and can delegate a full review to another party who need not be a blessed 
   reviewer.</p>

<p>When delegating, the responsibility for updating the request statuses 
   is in the blessed reviewer's hands.</p>

<h3>Overriding Reviews</h3>

<p>Normally, you may not override the review of another reviewer. That is,
  you can't clear their review flag and add your own. You are free to add
  your review flag as an <em>additional</em> flag, though.

<p>There are two exceptions ot this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A module owner can override a review in their module.</li>
  <li>The Project Leader can override any review.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two exceptions should be used <strong>extremely sparingly</strong>,
  though. Reviewers <em>are</em> the authority on reviews.</p>

<h3>Approval</h3>

<p>Once reviewing is complete, the patch needs to be approved.  The final
   reviewer should raise an "approval" request.</p>

<p>Approval is done by the project leader or blessed delegate.  The purpose
   of approval is for the project leader to be able to keep control of the
   entire Bugzilla product, to ensure similar, bad or conflicting features
   aren't introduced.  Approval does not usually involve in depth review of
   code, although nothing prohibits this.</p>

<p>If approval isn't granted, the approver might decide to ask for a rereview,
   a new patch, or resolve the bug entirely without checkin.</p>

<h3>Checking In</h3>

<p>Once the patch is reviewed and approved, it needs to be checked in. If the
   bug owner has checkin authority, they should check the patch in,
   otherwise any other reviewer should.</p>

<h2>Documentation Review</h2>
   <p>The review process above is for changes that can break Bugzilla. &nbsp;Things 
 that can't, ie documentation changes, follow different rules.</p>

<h2>Checking In &amp; Out</h2>
    <p>If you are a reviewer and wish to have checkin access, then you need
to follow the instructions  on the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/hacking/getting-cvs-write-access.html">
 mozilla.org checkin authority page</a>. &nbsp;When you file a bug, CC the 
project leader who will decide whether to vouch for you. &nbsp;Be sure to 
specify when filing the bug that you are applying for Webtools access only,
and so do not need a super-reviewer.<br>
    <br>
    Once you have checkin access, you need git software to check in and out.
    See your git documentation for more information about using git.<br>
    <br>
    To get a copy of the Bugzilla source code, run this command:<br>
    <br>
   <code>git clone https://git.mozilla.org/bugzilla/bugzilla.git bugzilla</code><br>
    <br>
    However, if you want to be able to check in, you must instead use a different
  path. Git's authentication is based on your ssh key, so as long as your account
  has an ssh key on file, it will know who you are. Everyone uses the same username.<br>
    <br>
  Your command would be:<br>
    <code>git clone ssh://gitolite3@git.mozilla.org/bugzilla/bugzilla.git bugzilla</code><br>
    </p>

<h2>How To Review</h2>
    <p>Reviewers should test the patch as well as visually review it.<br>
   <br>
   Although some aspects of reviewing a patch are formulaic, the process
is  by no means completely so. &nbsp;Reviewers should consider all aspects
of  the patch.<br>
   <br>
    The next sections are checklists that detail some of the things reviewers
  should look for. &nbsp;Because they are by no means a complete list of
things  to check, it is recommended they are not consulted until after the
review  is otherwise complete.</p>
