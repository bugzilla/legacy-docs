    <h1>Bugzilla Reviewers</h1>

    <p>This is a list of who to ask for review. You may ask any reviewer to review
    any change to any file, but they may defer it to another reviewer if they do not
    feel qualified.</p>

    <p>The following is a list of <em>all</em> people currently authorized to
    approve/deny review on patches.</p>

    <p>All changes to this list must be approved by
    <a href="mailto:justdave&#64;bugzilla.org">Dave Miller</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="become"></a>Become a Reviewer!</h2>

    <p>Think you'd make a good reviewer?  With the rapidly-growing
    Bugzilla community, we're increasingly needing good reviewers.
    We generally require that you've submitted some patches of your own 
    so that we can tell you know what you're doing.  If you are interested,
    contact <a href="mailto:justdave&#64;bugzilla.org">
    Dave Miller</a>, Bugzilla Project Manager, 
    and let him know you'd like to help out. If Dave agrees that  
    you're ready to become a reviewer, you will be added to this page. 
    You may be asked to spend some more time developing and submitting 
    patches, so we can get to know you better first.</p>
