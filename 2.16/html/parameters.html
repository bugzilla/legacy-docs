>&#13;      Bugzilla is configured by changing various parameters, accessed
      from the "Edit parameters" link in the page footer. Here are
      some of the key parameters on that page. You should run down this
      list and set them appropriately after installing Bugzilla.

> 
            The maintainer parameter is the email address of the person 
            responsible for maintaining this Bugzilla installation.
            The address need not be that of a valid Bugzilla account.

          </P
><P
>&#13;            For example, if your Bugzilla query page is
            <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi</TT
>, 
            set your <SPAN

>&#13;            This dictates whether or not to implement group-based security for
            Bugzilla. If set, Bugzilla bugs can have an associated 'group',
            defining which users are allowed to see and edit the
            bug.
          </P

>&#13;            Set <SPAN

            <EM

>&#13;            Bugzilla Products can have a group associated with them, so that
            certain users can only see bugs in certain products. When this
            parameter is set to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

            newly-created bugs in the group for their product immediately.

>shadowdb</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;            You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a
            high level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only table-level
            write locking. What this means is that if someone needs to make a
            change to a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation
            is complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
            complete. Note that more recent versions of mysql support row level
            locking using different table types. These types are slower than the
            standard type, and Bugzilla does not yet take advantage of features
            such as transactions which would justify this speed decrease. The
            Bugzilla team are, however, happy to hear about any experiences with
            row level locking and Bugzilla.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
> parameter was designed to get around
            this limitation. While only a single user is allowed to write to
            a table at a time, reads can continue unimpeded on a read-only
            shadow copy of the database. Although your database size will
            double, a shadow database can cause an enormous performance
            improvement when implemented on extremely high-traffic Bugzilla
            databases.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            As a guide, on reasonably old hardware, mozilla.org began needing 
            <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
> when they reached around 40,000 Bugzilla
            users with several hundred Bugzilla bug changes and comments per day.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            The value of the parameter defines the name of the shadow bug
            database. Set "shadowdb" to e.g. "bug_shadowdb" if you will be
            running a *very* large installation of Bugzilla.

            users to add themselves to the CC list, accept bugs, or
            change the Status Whiteboard without adding a comment as to
            their reasons for the change, yet require that most other

>&#13;            When Bugzilla is using Sendmail older than 8.12, turning this option

            send mail.  If Sendmail 8.12 or later is being used, there is 
            nothing to gain by turning this off.  If another MTA is being used, 
            such as Postfix, then this option *must* be turned on (even if you
