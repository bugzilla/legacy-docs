<h1>Query Cookbook</h1>

<p>As a bugzilla administrator, sometimes the queries I need to do are 
too specialized for the standard bugzilla query page and I have to do
them in SQL. I want to record some of these queries here for later
reference to save me from re-inventing the wheel.
Hopefully others will find this useful as well.</p>

<ul>

<li>
Search for bug owners who seem to have not used bugzilla in a while.
Send these people mail and disable the accounts of those that bounce.
Use the date that they last commented on a bug to decide whether they're
active. This isn't perfect, but its good enough since most bug operations
require a comment of some kind and in any case, we're not going to do anything
to them unless their mail bounces.
<pre>
SELECT MAX(bug_when) AS last_update,
       profiles.login_name AS email
FROM longdescs AS ld,
     bugs,
     profiles
WHERE ld.who = bugs.assigned_to
  AND ld.who = profiles.userid
GROUP BY email
HAVING last_update &lt; DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
;
</pre>
<p>
The above query probably would have done the job but our db is too huge 
to take the direct approach. I made a copy of the bugs db and deleted 
resolved bugs and 'old' comments. From this I created a list of owners
of open bugs and a list of owners who have commented recently. Subtracting
one list from the other creates a list of people who haven't.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Create a dump of the original database.
<pre>
% mysqldump bugs &gt; ~/bugs.dump
</pre></li>
<li>
Create a temporary database to hold your trimmed version of the db.
<pre>
% mysql
mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE tmp;
</pre></li>
<li>
Import the bug database.
<pre>
% mysql tmp &lt; bugs.dump
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Delete old long descriptions.
<pre>
DELETE FROM longdescs WHERE bug_when &lt; DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Remove bugs that aren't open.
<pre>
DELETE FROM bugs WHERE bug_status IN('RESOLVED', 'VERIFIED', 'CLOSED');
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The only bugs left are open ones. The only comments left are recent ones.
For each bug, print the owner if you can find a comment for them. This is
a list of bug owners with recent comments.
<pre>
SELECT p.login_name
FROM profiles p
     INNER JOIN bugs ON p.userid = bugs.assigned_to
     INNER JOIN longdescs ON bugs.assigned_to = longdescs.who
GROUP BY p.login_name
INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/aliveowners"
;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Make a list of all bug owners.
<pre>
SELECT p.login_name
FROM profiles p
     INNER JOIN bugs ON p.userid = bugs.assigned_to
GROUP BY p.login_name
INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/allowners"
;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Subtract the list of alive owners from the list of all owners to
get a list of owners of open bugs who haven't commented on a bug recently.
<pre>
% diff aliveowners allowners &gt; checkonthese
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Bugs assigned to people with disabled accounts.
<pre>
SELECT bugs.bug_id,
       p.login_name,
       comp.name,
       bugs.short_desc
FROM bugs
     INNER JOIN profiles p ON bugs.assigned_to = p.userid
     INNER JOIN components comp ON bugs.component_id = comp.id
WHERE bugs.bug_status IN('UNCONFIRMED', 'NEW', 'CONFIRMED', 'ASSIGNED', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'REOPENED')
  AND p.disabledtext != ""
;
</pre>
</li>


<li>
Bugs whose QA contact is disabled.
<pre>
SELECT bugs.bug_id,
       p.login_name,
       comp.name,
       bugs.short_desc
FROM bugs
     INNER JOIN profiles p ON bugs.qa_contact = p.userid
     INNER JOIN components comp ON bugs.component_id = comp.id
WHERE bugs.bug_status IN('UNCONFIRMED', 'NEW', 'CONFIRMED', 'ASSIGNED', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'REOPENED')
  AND p.disabledtext != ""
;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Count how many times a bug has been marked FIXED.
<pre>
SELECT bug_id,
       COUNT(bug_id) AS my_sum
FROM bugs_activity
WHERE added = 'FIXED'
GROUP BY bug_id
ORDER BY my_sum
;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
See who triages the most newly filed bugs by counting the number of times each person has changed bugs from the UNCONFIRMED state in the bug activity table. 
This includes confirming bugs and closing bugs without confirming them first
(e.g. marking as duplicate).
<pre>
SELECT COUNT(ba.bug_id) AS confirmsum,
       p.login_name
FROM profiles p,
     INNER JOIN bugs_activity ba ON p.userid = ba.who
     INNER JOIN fielddefs fd ON ba.fieldid = fd.fieldid
WHERE fd.name = 'bug_status'
  AND ba.removed = 'UNCONFIRMED'
GROUP BY p.login_name
ORDER BY confirmsum
;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Count how many bugs each person has confirmed. List the top 20 people in 
descending order.
<pre>
SELECT profiles.login_name AS email,
       COUNT(bug_id) AS bugcount

     INNER JOIN profiles ON ba.who = profiles.userid
     INNER JOIN fielddefs fd ON ba.fieldid = fd.fieldid

  AND ba.added = 1
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY bugcount DESC
LIMIT 20

</pre>
</li>

<li>
Count how many unconfirmed bugs people closed as INVALID, DUPLICATE or
WORKSFORME. Sort in descending order and list only the top ten.

GROUP BY email
ORDER BY bugcount DESC
LIMIT 10

</pre>
</li>

<li>
Count how many bugs each person has verified as INVALID.
<pre>

       COUNT(bugs.bug_id) AS bugcount

     INNER JOIN bugs_activity ba ON profiles.userid = ba.who

Count how many bugs each person has added attachments to.
<pre>

       COUNT(a.bug_id) AS bugcount

     INNER JOIN attachments a ON p.userid = a.submitter_id

</li>

<li>
List the top 100 bug reporters.
<pre>
SELECT profiles.login_name AS email,
       COUNT(bugs.bug_id) AS bugcount
FROM bugs
     INNER JOIN profiles ON bugs.reporter = profiles.userid
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY bugcount DESC
LIMIT 100
;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
List people who have reported more than 500 bugs.
<pre>
SELECT profiles.login_name AS email,
       COUNT(bugs.bug_id) AS bugcount
FROM bugs
     INNER JOIN profiles ON bugs.reporter = profiles.userid
GROUP BY email
HAVING bugcount &gt; 500
ORDER BY bugcount
;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
List the top ten largest attachments.
<pre>
SELECT p.login_name,

<li>
List all of the people who have granted or denied a review in the Bugzilla product in the last 6 months.

FROM bugs_activity AS act
     INNER JOIN profiles ON act.who = profiles.userid
     INNER JOIN bugs ON act.bug_id = bugs.bug_id
     INNER JOIN products ON bugs.product_id = products.id
WHERE DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 6 MONTH) &lt; act.bug_when
  AND (act.added = 'review+' OR act.added = 'review-')
  AND products.name = 'Bugzilla'
